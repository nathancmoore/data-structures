Stack Data Structure

We have implemented a stack data structure using a linked list. We use composition to utilize the existing
methods of the our previous Linked List Class.

Methods:

Push
The Push method inserts a new node adjusts the pointers such that the new node becomes the head of a list.

Pop
The Pop method returns the first node in a list, then removes it from the list.

Time Complexity.
Neither of these methods requires iteration through a list of elements. An element is merely selected and returned.
This is Constant Time or O(1).
